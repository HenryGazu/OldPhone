# OLDPHONE

>This program simulates the functionality of an old-fashioned mobile phone keypad, where each number is associated with a set of letters, as seen on telephone keypads. The user enters a sequence of numbers, where each number can be pressed multiple times to generate different letters, and the program converts that sequence into the corresponding text. Additionally, the program allows the use of the characters * to delete the last entry and # to end the entry and obtain the final result.
